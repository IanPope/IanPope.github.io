		<h1>This project wasn't actually that challenging for me. Both my partner and I have previous coding experience, and have both used python in the past as well. We actually split the development of the code in half. She did the first sixty-eight lines of code, while I did the last sixty three lines. To produce, and write the overall story, we both contributed our ideas, to improve the overall premise and storyline. Before her leave of absence to recover from her recent surgery, Bella showed me some shortcuts, like declaring a death variable that can be referred back to once, so it does not have to be declared every time the player dies. The overall process was both cooperative and independent, such as working on my half of the code. </h1>
